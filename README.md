# Mage is a Magento 2 library that makes magento backend easy again

**\Mage::** Facades provide an old good static interface to Magento classes that are available in the applicationâ€™s Mage service container (a place to store variables and objects to use them when needed). Which mean that we can use functions without making an object from class.
Facades provide a "static" interface to classes available in the application's service container. Laravel ships with many facades, which provide access to all Magento 2 features.

Mage facades serve as "static proxies" to underlying classes in the service container, providing the benefit of a terse, expressive syntax while maintaining more flexibility than traditional magento methods.

# Mage library is not only facades!

Magento 2 sucks, and Mage is here to resolve this issue. Adobe killed Magento with the scum and overengenered bloatware. Mage adding additional nice development features not available with Magento 2 core.
