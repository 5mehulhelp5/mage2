# Mage is a Magento 2 library make magento backend easy again

**Mage::** Facades provide old good static interface to Maggento classes that are available in the applicationâ€™s Mage service container (which is a place to store variables and objects to use them when we need). Which mean that we can use functions without making an object from class.
Facades provide a "static" interface to classes that are available in the application's service container. Laravel ships with many facades which provide access to all Magento 2 features.

MAge facades serve as "static proxies" to underlying classes in the service container, providing the benefit of a terse, expressive syntax while maintaining more flexibility than traditional magento methods.
It's perfectly fine if you don't totally understand how facades work - just go with the flow and continue learning about Mage library.
