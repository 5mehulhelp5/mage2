# Mage is a Magento 2 library that makes magento backend easy again

**\Mage::** Facades provide an old good static interface to Magento classes that are available in the applicationâ€™s Mage service container (a place to store variables and objects to use them when needed). Which mean that we can use functions without making an object from class.
Facades provide a "static" interface to classes available in the application's service container. Mage ships with many facades, which provide access to all Magento 2 features.

Mage facades serve as "static proxies" to underlying classes in the service container, providing the benefit of a terse, expressive syntax while maintaining more flexibility than traditional magento methods.

# Mage library is not only facades!

Magento 2 sucks, and Mage is here to resolve this issue. Adobe killed Magento with the scum and overengenered bloatware. Mage adding additional nice development features not available with Magento 2 core.
* Fast easy accesible fasades
* Easy Logger
* Fast, accessible Object manager
* Symfony Dumper features
* Kint Backtrace and Debug
* Eloquent/Laravel Query Builder and ORM (provided by Laragento)

# Advantages of the Mage::Facades

* improve the readability and usability by masking interaction with more complex components behind a single and often simplified API
* provide a context-specific interface to more generic functionality
* serve as a launching point for a broader refactor of monolithic or tightly-coupled Magento systems in favor of more loosely-coupled code

We are decided to use a facade design pattern because the magento 2 system is very overengenered/complex and obfuscated - difficult to understand because the system has many interdependent classes. Mage::facade pattern hides the complexities of the Magento 2 system and provides a simpler interface to the developers. It typically involves a single wrapper class that contains a set of members required by the client. These members access the system on behalf of the facade clients and hide the implementation details.

# Mage DB facade 

Magento 2  interacts with a database using outdate Zend_DB library and slow legacy ORM. Mage DB2 based on Laravel/DB makes interacting with databases extremely simple and fast using raw SQL, a fluent Laravel query builder, and the Eloquent ORM in conjunction with Laragento package.

Also Laravel collections provide a variety of extremely powerful methods for mapping and reducing data. For more information check awesom Laravel documentation.

Several example:
get all date from order table
$orders = DB2::table('sales_order');

specify select statements 

$users = DB2::table('users')
            ->select('name', 'email as user_email')
            ->get();

join 

$users = DB2::table('users')
            ->join('contacts', 'users.id', '=', 'contacts.user_id')
            ->join('orders', 'users.id', '=', 'orders.user_id')
            ->select('users.*', 'contacts.phone', 'orders.price')
            ->get();

insert

DB2::table('users')->insert([
    ['email' => 'picard@example.com', 'votes' => 0],
    ['email' => 'janeway@example.com', 'votes' => 0],
]);
